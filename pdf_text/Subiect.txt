Exercise 1 (25p).Imagine a Turing Machine that has two heads and one tape.
You need to:
1. Give formal denition of this type of TM
2. Give a clear explanation of computation for this type of TM. Include a
formal description of computation
Exercise 2 (20p).Implement a library/program in a programming language of
your choosing to load and validate a conguration le of a TM with two heads
and one tape. Also implement a simulator for this type of TM
Exercise 3 (25p).Create a conguration le for a two head, one tape TM that
recognize the language L=fw#w0jwhere w' is a prex of w g
Exercise 4 (30p).Create a conguration le of a (normal) or two-head, one
tape TM that performs addition of two natural numbers
